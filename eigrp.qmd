# EIGRP

-   Classic/Named Mode
    -   Classic: Commands under router process + Interfaces
    -   Named: Config in SubSections - Address Family, Interface & Topology
-   AD 90internal, 170External
-   **Hello**'s are Multicast on **224.0.0.10**, port **88**
-   Timers
    -   Hello-default 5 secs),
-   Load balance over unequal paths using `variance` unlike OSPF (equal only)
-   Uses K Values for Metrics (K1-5, Bandwidth, Delay, Reliability, Load, MTU)
    -   Mostly uses

        -   K1 - Bandwidth - slowest in path
        -   K3 - Delay - cumulative
-   Supports VLSM by sending mask
-   Can configure neighbour specifically to use **Unicast**
-   Uses RTP (reliable transport protocol - confirms messages neighbour received messages but not hellow
-   Uses DUAL (Difussing identifies neighbour with lowest Feasible Distance
    -   FD set to **Infinity** to indicate the router is in transition & seeking alternative paths
-   3 Data Structures
    -   `Neighbour Table` - Who our EIGRP neighbours are
    -   `Interface Table` - which interfaces are participating
    -   `Topology Table` - shows routes known to EIGRP
-   Router-ID (highest configured + active Loopback, then any IPv4"

## Messages & Timers

*Help Up Queeg, Rimmer, Really Aces*

-   **Hello** - used to discover neighbours, (Hold time = how long neighbour should wait, different to
-   **Update** -
-   **Query** -
-   **Request** -
-   **Reply** -
-   **Acknowledge** -

## Path Selection

-   **Reported Distance** - cost to destination from neighbouring router
-   **Feasible Distance** - RD + path cost to get to neighbouring router.
-   **Successor Route** - the lowest cost path to route
-   **Successor** - First Hop route on that path
-   **Feasibility Condition** - That the **RD** must be less than the **FD** (loop prevention)
-   **Feasible Successor** - route which passes the feasibility condition.

## EIGRP - Traditional IPv4 Configuration

``` default
CLASSIC
router eigrp 10 
network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255           - If any interfaces match & configured/up they should participate in EIGRP
network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.3
network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255      - Makes all interfaces participate in EIGRP

## Useful Show Commands

`show ip route EIGRP` - shows EIGRP routes installed into the RIB

`show ip eigrp interfaces` - shows active EIGRP interfaces

`show ip eigrp topology all-links` - shows all additional paths to network (failed Feasibility Condition)

`show ip protocols` - displays EIGRP process ID, ASN, K values, RID, Neighbours, AD + Passive Ints

Stuck in Active - router sends query about network, doesn't hear back and thinks it's neighbor has died.
