*Help Up Queeg, Rimmer, Really Aces*

-   **Hello** - used to discover neighbours

    -   Hello Interval - time between sending hellos to neighbour - Default 5 seconds
    -   Hold Time - time I tell my neighbor to wait for me - Default 15 Seconds
    -   This is different to OSPF where the dead timer is how long I wait.
