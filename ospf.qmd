# General Notes

-   Link State Routing Protocol - makes routing decisions based on the state of links.

-   Once adjacency formed each router has the same **Link State Database.**

-   Reacts only to changes, no constant flooding of updates.

-   AD - 110 for Internal & External

-   Process-ID - **Locally** significant.

-   Timers (Default):

    -   Hello - 10
    -   Dead Interval - 40 (How long local router waits to hear neighbours Hello
    -   Wait Timer - 40 (How long to wait for DR/BDR to be elected before triggering election)
    -   Retransmit - 5 (how long to wait to retransmit OSPF packet which hasn't been acknowledged)

-   224.0.0.5 - Broadcast for All OSPF Routers (Broadcast)

-   224.0.0.6 - Broadcast for All Designates Routers

-   Neighbourship Requirements

    -   Matching Area
    -   Matching Auth Parameters
    -   Matching Subnet
    -   Matching Timers
    -   Matching Stub Flags
    -   Matching MTU (Exstart/Exchange State)

-   DR/BDR to optimise adjacencies

    -   DR/BDR Election
        -   Highest Priority value (0 to remove from election)
        -   Highest Router-ID
        -   Highest IP on Loopback Int
        -   Highest IP on interface that's UP

-   Metric Calculation

    -   Bandwidth \\ References Bandwidth - Default ref is 100Mb (all interfaces \> 100M have same ref cost.
        -   Change ref bandwith with `auto-cost reference bandwidth [value]` big kev recommends 2TB!
        -   Should match across topology but won't stop neighbourships forming.

-   Troubleshooting - **TAN MAT** (**T**imers, **A**rea, **N**etwork Add, **M**TU, **A**uth, **T**ype)
