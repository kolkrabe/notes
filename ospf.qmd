-   Once adjacency formed each router has the same **Link State Database.**

-   Reacts only to changes, no constant flooding of updates.

-   AD - 110 for Internal & External

-   Process-ID - **Locally** significant.

-   Timers (Default):

    -   Hello - 10
    -   Dead Interval - 40 (How long local router waits to hear neighbours Hello

-   224.0.0.5 - Broadcast for All OSPF Routers (Broadcast)

-   224.0.0.6 - Broadcast for All Designates Routers

-   Neighbourship Requirements

    -   Matching Area
    -   Matching Auth Parameters
    -   Matching Subnet
    -   Matching Timers
    -   Matching Stub Flags
    -   Matching MTU (Exstart/Exchange State)

-   DR/BDR to optimise adjacencies

    -   DR/BDR Election
        -   Highest Priority value (0 to remove from election)
        -   Highest Router-ID
        -   Highest IP on Loopback Int
