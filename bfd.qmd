-   BFD is a lightweight *(small fixed packets)* protocol used to determine a link failure between L3 non-directly connected routers.

    -   Sub Second failure
    -   1 session per address family per interface (regardless of how many protocols run on it).
    -   Supports OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, IS-IS

-   Connection types in question

    -   L2 Switched Network
    -   VPN Tunnels
    -   DMVPN without LOS Propagation

-   Works with all Media Types, routing protocols, topologies and encapsulations.

-   Requirements

    -   **CEP + IP Routing** must be enabled
    -   IP Routing protocol supported by BFD must be configured before BFD is configured
