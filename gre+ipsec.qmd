#### **General Notes**

-   **GRE**
    -   Stands for Generic Route Encapsulation
    -   Tunneling method that can tunnel many different protocols inside GRE header
    -   Used as default encapsulation method for Cisco tunnel interfaces
    -   IP protocol type **47** used in IP header
-   **Security features of IPSec**
    -   **Data origin authentication**
        -   Verifying where packet came from
    -   **Data integrity**
        -   Ensuring packet wasn’t changed in transit
    -   **Confidentiality**
        -   Encryption, preventing packet from being intercepted and read
        -   Prevented by limited allowed window
    -   Confidentiality is the mainly thought-of core feature
-   IPSec uses symmetric key encryption
-   Point-to-point tunnels in almost all cases, GETVPN can be P2MP
-   Tunnel keys dynamically negotiated through IKE
-   IKEv2 is superior but not supported by all platforms

##### **Phases**

-   Phase one establishes ISAKMP SA, secure tunnel to negotiate phase two through
-   Phase two establishes IPsec SA, tunnel used to protect actual data traffic
-   **In Phase 1:**
    -   Authentication either PSK (Pre-shared key) or certificate based
    -   DH^[1](https://brunbattery.github.io/NetworkNotes/IPsec%20&%20GRE%20VPN.html#fn1)^ used to exchange crypto keys
        -   Higher DH group number is more secure
    -   Encryption algorithms used to protect traffic
        -   Possibilities include DES, 3DES, AES-128, AES-256, etc
    -   Hash algorithm used to ensure packet wasn’t modified in transit
        -   IKEv1 supports MD5, SHA-1
    -   Tunnel lifetime is negotiated
    -   IKE parameters *must match* in order for phase 1 to complete successfully
    -   Main mode and aggressive mode both options for completing this step
        -   Main mode preferred as aggressive has security issues
-   **In Phase 2, following are negotiated:**
    -   Security protocol

        -   ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) or AH (Authentication Header)
        -   AH does not support encryption, rarely used

    -   Encapsulation modes

        -   Tunnel or transport
        -   Tunnel adds new IP header, used for actually tunneling traffic
        -   Transport mode used for host-to-host applications or combined with GRE which does the tunneling itself

    -   Encryption (used for actual data traffic, not just tunnel)

        -   DES, 3DES, AES-128, AES-256, etc

    -   Authentication (hashing)

        -   MD5, SHA, etc

    -   Combination of the above called IPsec **Transform Set**

    -   Only performed in QM (quick mode)
-   UDP 500 (ISAKMP), 4500 (NAT-T) are ports used to establish control plane
    -   4500 is only used with NAT-T^[2](https://brunbattery.github.io/NetworkNotes/IPsec%20&%20GRE%20VPN.html#fn2)^
-   IPsec data plane uses IP protocol **50** (ESP), **51** (AH) in the IP header

#### **Useful show/debug commands**

-   **Phase 1:**
    -   `show crypto isakmp sa` - should show **QM_IDLE** as state and status as **ACTIVE**
    -   `debug crypto isakmp`, or `debug crypto condition peer ipv4 <IP>` to debug for one specific peer
-   **Phase 2:**
    -   `show crypto ipsec sa [<peer IP>`\]
    -   `debug crypto ipsec`
