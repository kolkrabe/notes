## General Info

-   Dynamic Multi Point VPN - DMVPN
-   Highly scalable system to connect multiple sites using Hub-and-Spoke topology using **mGRE** (Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation)
    -   Spoke to Spoke Tunnels can be created on demand
-   Uses **NHRP (**Next Hop Resolution Protocol) - acts like DNS
    -   **NHS** (Next Hop Server) - configured on all spokes
    -   Spokes register their physical & tunnel interface IP's with the **NHS**
    -   NHS Populates it's NHRP Cache to maintain a database of it's spokes
    -   Spokes can query the **NHS** to obtain the tunnel IP it needs to form direct tunnel.

## DMVPN Phases

-   **Phase 1**
    -   All traffic between spokes must traverse Hub, no spoke-to-spoke.
-   **Phase 2**
    -   Allows spoke-to-spoke traffic by making all tunnels (including spokes) multipoint
    -   This allows spokes to form tunnels directly to each other
    -   Must not have routing protocol use next-hop-self or the tunnels will not form
    -   Does ***NOT*** work with summarization - since the RIB will not have a route to the other spokes, all traffic will transit the hub
    -   If using OSPF, network type must be broadcast or non-broadcast to prevent changing next-hops
        -   In this scenario the spokes must be set at priority 0 to prevent them becoming DRs - if spokes become DRs the network will not function as they cannot multicast between each other
-   **Phase 3**
    -   Allows spoke-to-spoke traffic by using NHRP redirect and shortcut commands that allow NHRP to rewrite next hops in the RIB
    -   Main benefit over phase 2 is allowing summarization from hubs to spokes - spokes will still be able to form tunnels to each other in phase 3 even with a default route from the hub

## Useful Show Commands

-   `show interface tunnel [number]` - shows state of tunnel interface
-   `show dmvpn [detail]` - shows tunnel status, peers, up/down time, etc
-   `show ip nhrp [brief]` - shows NHRP cache, NHRP-specific details useful for phase 2, 3
-   `show ip route next-hop-override` - shows NH overrides for DMVPN phase 3
-   `show ip cef [IP address]` - shows how the switch will deal with this IP address - send to tunnel?
-   `show crypto isakmp sa; show crypto ike2 sa; show crypto ipsec sa` - for troubleshooting IPsec when used with DMVPN

## Configuration

### **DMVPN Phase 1 Configuration (No IPsec)**

**Hub Config**

``` default
! Essential 
interface Tunnel100 
ip address 192.168.100.11 255.255.255.0 
ip nhrp map multicast dynamic 
ip nhrp network-id 100 
tunnel source GigabitEthernet0/1 
tunnel mode gre multipoint 

! Discretionary 
bandwidth 4000 
ip mtu 1400 
ip tcp adjust-mss 1360 
ip nhrp authentication NHRPAUTH 
no ip split-horizon eigrp 100  ! necessary for EIGRP 
tunnel key 100                 ! necessary in multi-hub designs
```

**Spoke Config**

``` default
interface Tunnel100 
ip address 192.168.100.31 255.255.255.0 
ip nhrp network-id 100 
ip nhrp nhs [Hub TunnelIP] nbma [Hub Public IP] multicast 
tunnel source GigabitEthernet0/1 
tunnel destination [Hub Public IP]  

! Discretionary 
bandwidth 4000 
ip mtu 1400 
ip tcp adjust-mss 1360 
ip nhrp authentication NHRPAUTH 
tunnel key 100                 ! necessary in multi-hub designs
```

### **DMVPN Phase 2 Configuration (No IPsec)**

**Hub Config**

``` default
!same as Phase 1, but including:  

no ip next-hop-self eigrp 100  

!so that hub doesn't list itself as NH for spokes
```

**Spoke Config**

``` default
!same as Phase 1, but including:  

tunnel mode gre multipoint  

!so that spokes can form direct tunnels
```

### **DMVPN Phase 3 Configuration (No IPsec)**

**Hub Config**

``` default
!same as Phase 1, but including:  

ip nhrp redirect  

!so that hub will forward redirect messages to spokes after initial traffic,  allowing spoke-to-spoke tunnels to form
```

**Spoke Config**

``` default
!same as Phase 1, but including:  

ip nhrp shortcut 
tunnel mode gre multipoint  

!to allow the spokes to install NHRP next hops into the routing table and form direct tunnels
```

### **DMVPN IKEv1 IPsec Configuration**

**VRFless**

``` default
crypto isakmp policy 10  
 encr aes 128  
 hash sha256  
 authentication pre-share  
 group 16 
!
crypto isakmp key DMVPN_PSK address 0.0.0.0   
! 
crypto ipsec transform-set [ESP-AES-256-SHA-512] esp-aes 256 esp-sha512-hmac   
 mode transport 
! 
crypto ipsec profile DMVPN_PROFILE
 set transform-set [ESP-AES-256-SHA-512] 
!
interface Tunnel0 
tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN_PROFILE
```

**FVRF**

``` default
!same as above, but instead of crypto isakmp key: 

crypto keyring VRF_AWARE_PSK vrf UNDERLAY_TRANSPORT    
 pre-shared-key address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 key DMVPN_PSK
```

### **DMVPN IKEv2 IPsec Configuration (See IPsec page for deep dive)**

**VRFless**

``` default
crypto ikev2 keyring DMVPN-KEYRING
 peer ANY 
  address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0               !(Any peer)
  pre-shared-key CISCO456 
! 
crypto ikev2 profile DMVPN-IKE 
 match identity remote address 0.0.0.0 
 authentication remote pre-share 
 authentication local pre-share 
 keyring local DMVPN-KEYRING 
! 
crypto ipsec transform-set SET1 esp-aes 256 esp-sha-hmac 
 mode transport 
! 
crypto ipsec profile DMVPN-IPSEC 
 set transform-set SET1 
 set ikev2-profile DMVPN-IKE 
!
interface Tunnel0 
 tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN-IPSEC
```

**FVRF**

``` default
!Same as above, but under crypto ikev2 profile:  match fvrf INET
```
