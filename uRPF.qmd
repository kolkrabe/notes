## General Info

-   Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding
-   Security mechanism to inspect and validate source IP of packet by checking return path in
-   Requires CEF to be enabled
-   Stops router pinging itself when enabled (can be permitted using `allow-self-ping` flag

## **uRPF Modes**

-   **Strict mode**
    -   If the return path to the source IP of the traffic does not match the ingress interface, the traffic will be discarded
    -   Configured with the `rx` flag on the `ip verify unicast source` command
-   **Loose mode**
    -   If a return path to the source IP of the traffic does not exist in the routing table, the traffic will be discarded
    -   Configured with the `any` flag on the `ip verify unicast source` command
-   **Allow-default**
    -   Used to allow a default route to be used as a return path - by default this is not allowed with uRPF
    -   Configured with the `allow-default` flag on the `ip verify unicast source` command

## Useful Show Commands

-   `show ip traffic` - shows drops
-   `show cef interface [int]` - shows whether uRPF & CEF are enabled

## Standard Config

``` default
int gi0/1
ip verify unicast source reachable-via [rx | any] [allow-default]
```
