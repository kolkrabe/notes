SPT Loopguard protects against L2 loops, enabled per port.

-   If non designated port stops receiving BPDUs, loopguard moves the port to "STP Loop-inconsistent blocking state, rather than listening/learning/forwarding which would cause a loop.
-   Once BPDU received again the port is transitioned and doesn't require intervention.

DHCP Option 82 - Relay Agent Information Option

-   Increases DHCP security by enabling identification of request sources and,
-   allows address allocation based on network topology or client device characteristics.
-   When DHCP Snooping + IP Source Guard enabled - DHCP server must support option 82.
    -   Enable: `ip dhcp snooping information option`

DHCP Option 66 - next-server option - ip/hostname of TFTP or HTTP server for client to download files from.
