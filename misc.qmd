SPT Loopguard protects against L2 loops, enabled per port.

-   If non designated port stops receiving BPDUs, loopguard moves the port to "STP Loop-inconsistent blocking state, rather than listening/learning/forwarding which would cause a loop.
-   Once BPDU received again the port is transitioned and doesn't require intervention.
