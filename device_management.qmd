# Console & VTY Lines

## Console line connection requirements

-   9600 Baud
-   8 data bits
-   1 stop bit
-   no parity
-   Generally no password by default. If line password is configured `Login` needs to be configured on the line.
-   `Login Local` - uses Local user DB `Login authentication xxx` - uses configured aaa servers.

---

### VTY Line troubleshooting

1)  Is it Reachable?
2)  Transport protocols permitted with allowed protocols?

-   `Transport input \[ssh/telnet\]`
-   `show line vty \[line number\] \| include Allowed`

3)  Auth setup?

-   `Login` configured on line, line password configured
-   `Login local` configured - refer to local user DB â€¢ If Login specified but no password set -error - "Password required but none set"

3)  ACL?
4)  VTY Lines Busy?
    a.  "Show users" - will show active users
    b.  "clear line \[number\]" used to clear a line

Useful show commands

`Show users` - will show active users

## Standard Line Config

``` default
(config)# exec -enables the line 
(config)# no exec -disables exec access to line line 
(config)# exec-timeout 5 0 -sets logout timer as 5 minutes of inactivity
```
